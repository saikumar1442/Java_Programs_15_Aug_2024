2. Refactoring (ETL Mapping)

ETL mapping can reduce the workload of data analytics operations. By using ETL, delegate much of the time-consuming workload to the software. The Refactor table identifies the refactoring that have been started. A code-refactoring exercise will generally be self-contained within a single application

Improved ETL Mapping Concepts

Note : ETL mapping allows data analysts to spend less time extracting,


Key Role Outcomes :

1. Team Work :

I enjoy working with others, and I know how to communicate well, actively listen to my associates’ opinions, and mediate any conflicts that arise. As an extrovert, I’m really energized by team dynamics and excited as I witness the progress we make towards our goals.

2. Delivery Excellence

Delivering the projects on-time and that value is effectively delivered to customers.

4. Operational Excellence

I am putting the full efforts on the task which has been provided.

5. Adherence to Coding Standards

Wrote understandable and effective code.
Helper methods were used to keep the code short and to the point.
Refrained from using any hard coding besides constants.
To avoid any loss and to facilitate team collaboration, I regularly save and upload my code to Github.
